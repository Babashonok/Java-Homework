Conclusion :
During the execution of the profile loading main goal was :  testing the extreme response time during
simultaneous multiple users login. 
The lagrest time span in login load test was 1252 ms in 10 threads login loading test.
When the amount of threads increased , avegare and highest response time still was in stable state.
A further increase of threads would be impratical besause of lack of computer operating capabilities.
